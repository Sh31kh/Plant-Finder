I developed this project as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, where I achieved a strong score of 62 out of 70. For the coursework, we were tasked with designing and creating a solution to a real-world problem. Inspired by my fascination with image recognition, I set out to develop a Python-based application that incorporated this technology.

With only five months to learn, design, and implement the solution, time constraints posed significant challenges. As highlighted in the documentation, this limited timeframe meant I couldnâ€™t fully implement all the features I had envisioned, but the experience was invaluable in enhancing my skills and understanding.
